        It has been a little while since my last blog post. I have been really busy with school and developing content
        for my classes. I have added my recent school project to our <a href="/projects"
          class="accent-link heading-6">Projects</a> page. Since classes have ended I have been busy revamping the
        SurfTurkey.net official website. In case you were wondering, this is the offical SurfTurkey.net website. I
        have also posted the previous version on our <a href="/projects"
          class="accent-link heading-6">Projects</a> page so that you can compare it to the new version. I am very
        excited for what the future of SurfTurkey will come to be now that I am honing my skills with CSS and
        Javascript. You'll notice more styling and interactive components being added to the new version of the
        website. I hope you enjoy!

        For myself, developing in tech has always been a lifelong desire. Developing and creating content for the
        Internet has intrigued me since I was a young person. Another lifelong passion of mine has been service.
        Providing a service that is useful to someone else has been my mission in my working life since day one. I
        started out my working experiences in the service industry and have always cleaved closely to opportunities to
        provide for others. Whether it be in a restaurant, a store, a volunteer effort, or troubleshooting technical
        issues at my day job - being a dependable source of help has been my directive. But what about creating
        content? Where did that desire go missing in my life path? For a variety of reasons my focus on developing
        content for the Internet was not realized.
      <br>
        It wasn't until I decided to make a new path for myself in 2021, after meeting my soon-to-be wife and being
        inspired to return to school and finish my degree in tech, that I reignited my passion for developing content
        for 'the web'. Marrying my passion for tech and my desire to provide a useable service, I stepped out on my
        own path. I am putting forth my efforts to bring local businesses into the modern era of business. In a world
        where nearly everyone is constantly connected to outside sources of information it is crucial now more than
        ever for companies to invest in getting recognized, and producing a viable product for their brand. We at
        SurfTurkey have decided to make it our utmost goal to develop content for the businesses that would benefit
        from the services that we will deliver.
