      <p class="about__trey">
        Greetings! My name is Trey and I am a web developer. I decided to
        startup my own web development firm while finishing my associates
        degree in web technologies at Forsyth Technical Community College.
        I am a native of Asheboro, NC and I am currently residing in Winston Salem, NC. I work in a tech
        support role in the healthcare industry here in Winston. I live with my fiance, Courtney, and we've
        been together since 2019.
        <img id="dogs-photo" class="about__img" src="../assets/img/bodhiwoods.jpg" alt="My two dogs, Bodhi and Woods." />

        I enjoy a morning pot of coffee and time with my two dogs. I also enjoy games of all sorts - party games,
        strategy games, card games, and the occasional video game. I find pleasure in many genres of music and I love
        going to live events. I found my love for web development all the way back in 1997 and even
        developed a few websites for small businesses in the time before Y2K. Today I am prepared to
        finish my associate degree in web technologies and I will graduate in
        May 2024. I look forward to collaborating with you in the development of your next project!

      <p class="about__adia">
        Hi, my name is Adia Chue. I am a photographer, musician, artist, and web designer. I gravitate to all things art
        and design related. In my spare time I produce photography and craft projects. I enjoy traveling to new
        locations when the opportunity arises, and shopping is by far my favorite leisure activity. I am a Brooklyn
        native, but I have been in the Triad area for most of my life. I am a graduate of UNC Greensboro where I studied
        music. Additionally, I am a graduate of the web technologies program at Forsyth Tech in Winston Salem, NC. I am
        excited to begin utilizing my new creative outlet - designing web content. And as a designer I am personally
        invested in developing content that is unique and eye-catching. I also have a niche interest in SEO (search
        engine optimization) so as to elevate the exposure of your brand on the Internet. I look forward to working with
        you on your next project!
